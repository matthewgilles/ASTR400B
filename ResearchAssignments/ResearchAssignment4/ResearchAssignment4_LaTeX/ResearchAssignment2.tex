%% A significant change from AASTeX v6+ is in the author blocks. Now an email
%% address is required for each author. This means that each author requires
%% at least one of the following:
%%
%% \author
%% \affiliation
%% \email
%%
%% If these three commands are not available for each author, the latex
%% compiler will issue an error and if you force the latex compiler to continue,
%% it will generate an incomplete pdf.
%%
%% Multiple \affiliation commands are allowed and authors can also include
%% an optional \altaffiliation to indicate a status, i.e. Hubble Fellow. 
%% while affiliations are indexed as footnotes, altaffiliations are noted with
%% with a non-numeric footnote that is set away from the numeric \affiliation 
%% footnotes. NOTE that if an \altaffiliation command is used it must 
%% come BEFORE the \affiliation call, right after the \author command, in 
%% order to place the footnotes in the proper location. Because non-numeric
%% symbols are used, \altaffiliation should be used sparingly.
%%
%% In v7 the \author command takes an optional argument which provides 
%% additional metadata about the author. Authors can provide the 16 digit 
%% ORCID, the surname (family or last) name, the given (first or fore-) name, 
%% and a name suffix, e.g. "Jr.". The syntax is:
%%
%% \author[orcid=0000-0002-9072-1121,gname=Gregory,sname=Schwarz]{Greg Schwarz}
%%
%% This name metadata in not shown, it is only for parsing by the peer review
%% system so authors can be more easily identified. This name information will
%% also be sent to the publisher so they can include it in the CROSSREF 
%% metadata. Including an orcid will hyperlink the author name to the 
%% author's ORCID page. Note that  during compilation, LaTeX will do some 
%% limited checking of the format of the ID to make sure it is valid. If 
%% the "orcid-ID.png" image file is  present or in the LaTeX pathway, the 
%% ORCID icon will appear next to the authors name.
%%
%% Even though emails are now required for each author, the \email does not
%% produce output in the compiled manuscript unless the optional "show" command
%% is used. For example,
%%
%% \email[show]{greg.schwarz@aas.org}
%%
%% All "shown" emails are show in the bottom left of the first page. Due to
%% space constraints, only a few emails should be shown. 
%%
%% To identify a corresponding author, use the \correspondingauthor command.
%% The command appends "Corresponding Author: " to the argument it appears at
%% the bottom left of the first page like the output from \email. 

\author[gname='Matthew', sname='Gilles']{Matthew Gilles}
\affiliation{University of Arizona}
\email[show]{matthewgilles@arizona.edu}  

%% Use the \collaboration command to identify collaborations. This command
%% takes an optional argument that is either a number or the word "all"
%% which tells the compiler how many of the authors above the command to
%% show. For example "\collaboration[all]{(DELVE Collaboration)}" wil include
%% all the authors above this command.
%%
%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. 

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. 
%% The AAS Journals now uses Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) concepts:
%% https://astrothesaurus.org
%% You will be asked to selected these concepts during the submission process
%% but this old "keyword" functionality is maintained in case authors want
%% to include these concepts in their preprints.
%%
%% You can use the \uat command to link your UAT concepts back its source.

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label

\section{Introduction}

The Milky Way Galaxy (MW) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M3) are both
members of the Local Group. The \textbf{Local Group} is a cluster of
around fifty galaxies and spans about ten billion light-years. These
two galaxies (i.e. MW and M31) will eventually undergo a galactic
merger. This event will cause both galaxies to undergo serious 
cosmological changes. One thing that will evolve over the merger
is the structure of MW and M31. Both galaxies have a stellar disk and
stellar bulge region with their own properties. The \textbf{stellar
disk} and \textbf{stellar bulge} refer to the stars that make up the
disk and bulge components respectively within each galaxy. When MW and
M31 merge within the next seven billion years, these two regions will
interact with each other and combine. The dynamical forces, namely the
tidal forces, will influence the result of this merger and the ongoing
evolution of the two galaxies.

Density is a property of a galaxy that influences many different
phenomena related to galactic evolution
\citep{Torrey_Cox_Kewley_Hernquist_2012}. A \textbf{galaxy} is a
gravitationally bound set of stars, gas, and dust whose
characteristics and behaviour cannot be explained with Newton's laws
of gravity. \textbf{Galactic evolution} is the process of the galaxy
and its components changing over time. By observing the surface
density of the galaxies as they merge over time we can learn about how
galactic mergers influence evolution. With how old the universe is, it
is difficult to see the whole picture that is galactic evolution. A
galactic merger can hopefully allow us to see how a galaxy evolves in
a shorter amount of time.

We know that after MW and M31 merge, the merger remnant will have a
significantly larger radius that the original galaxies
\citep{van_der_Marel_Besla_Cox_Sohn_Anderson_2012}. With this, the
surface density after the merger should follow a distribution similar
to a de Vaucouleurs profile \citep{Brooks_Christensen_2016}. This
means that the new elliptical merger remnant will have its density
scale with the radius to the power of a quarter (outside of 1 kpc from
the centre). Figure 1 shows the particles originating from MW and M31
respectively after the merger. It can be seen that the shape of the
merger remnant consisting of MW and M31 should be elliptical when
viewed face on.

%% The "ht!" tells LaTeX to put the figure "here" first, at the "top" next
%% and to override the normal way of calculating a float position.
%% The asterisk after "figure" tells the compiler to span multiple columns
%% if a two column style is selected.

\label{fig:general}}
\end{figure*}

There are several questions relating to the evolution of the surface
density profiles during the galactic merger. A very good question is
how will the forces acting on the galaxies during the merger change
their surface density profiles. Hopefully, by analyzing the way the
galaxy surface density changes throughout this interaction and compare
it to the initial densities and the density of the merger remnant, we
can learn more about how galactic mergers and their density profiles
impact galactic evolution. There is also the question of how the
merger will impact the form of the two galaxies. As
aforementioned, the merger remnant should be elliptical. The shape and
density of the merger remnant could help us learn how to more easily
identify other similar merger remnants. In the same vein, something
must happen to the spiral arms of MW and M31 as the galaxies go from a
spiral classification to an elliptical merger remnant. The tidal
forces acting on the spiral arms cause them to evolve in such a way
that the arms lose their definition during the merger. The simplest
way to attempt to solve any of these questions is to use a simulation
of the galactic interactions
\citep{van_der_Marel_Besla_Cox_Sohn_Anderson_2012}.

\section{This Project} \label{sec:style}

The topic of this paper is to investigate the surface density and
Sersic profiles of MW and M31. The \textbf{Sersic profile} is a
method used to analyze the surface density of a galaxy by using the
relation between the galaxy's radius and intensity.

The question I will be answering is how the surface densities and
Sersic profiles of the disks and bulges of MW and M31 evolve over the
course of the galactic merger.

While galactic mergers result in a new galactic form, the intermediate
steps are just as important. The density and intensity of stars within
a galaxy are very important parameters for a galaxy and by calculating
and analyzing these values during the merger we may be able to see how
these distributions evolve and are effected by the forces taking place
in the merger event.

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:style}

In order to answer this question, I will have to complete a number of
steps using the N-body merger simulation. The N-body simulation is
referred to as such because it is a simulation modeling "N" number of
particles used to represent the stars within a galaxy
\citep{van_der_Marel_Besla_Cox_Sohn_Anderson_2012}. This simulation in
particular contains the stars for MW, M31, and M33 within all of their
galaxy components (i.e. halo, disk, and bulge). The simulation
contains the three dimensional positions and velocities of all these
particles as well as their mass and position in time. I will be
looking at surface density and Sersic profiles at various times for
the disk and bulge regions of both MW and M31.

As previously stated, I will look at both the evolution of the disk
(i.e. particle type 2) and the bulge (i.e. particle type 3). I would
like to analyze the two galaxies at specific points in time using the
LowRes files of the simulation. The LowRes files can be used since
density is a value that does not depend on the tracking of each
individual particle within the system. I will look at the initial
conditions (i.e. snapshot 000), the first close encounter at four
gigayears (i.e. snapshot 280), and the time they separate after that
encounter at five and a half gigayears (i.e. snapshot 385). These
values were found using Figure 2 to look at the separation between MW
and M31 during the galactic merger.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{MWM31RS.png}
\caption{Plot showing the radial separation between the centre of mass of MW and M31 in kpc at a given time in Gyr.
\label{fig:general}}
\end{figure*}

At these times, I will calculate the Sersic profile for each galaxy
and find the associated Sersic index that fits best. To do this, I
will need to first compute the centre of mass of each galaxy for the
given snapshot and the masses of each relevant component. I will need
to do this so that I can then find the surface density for both the disk and the bulge using the equation below.
\begin{equation}
\sigma=\frac{M_{ann}}{\pi(r_n^2-r_{n-1}^2)}
\end{equation}
In order to use this equation, we must first create an annulus that
encloses the majority of the galactic region. With this, you can find
the sum of the mass enclosed at each annulus then take the difference
between the current point and the one previous to find the mass at the
current annulus value. This value is \begin{math}M_{ann}\end{math}.
\begin{math}r_{n}\end{math} is the current radius from the annulus and
\begin{math}r_{n-1}\end{math} is the radius in the index before. This
allows us to calculate our surface density over the entire component of
the galaxy \begin{math}\sigma\end{math}. With the surface densities, I
can then calculate the Sersic profiles using the equations below.
\begin{equation}
I_e=\frac{L}{7.2\pi R_e^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I(r)=I_ee^{-(2n-\frac{1}{3})((\frac{r}{R_e})^{1/n}-1)}
\end{equation}
\begin{math}L\end{math} is the luminosity of the galaxy component which
can be found using the mass-to-light ratio and
\begin{math}R_e\end{math} is the half light radius. With those values
the Sersic profile \begin{math}I(r)\end{math} can be calculated at
each value of \begin{math}r\end{math}, \begin{math}r\end{math} being
the distance from the centre of the galaxy in kilo-parsecs.
\begin{math}n\end{math} is then the Sersic index that best aligns the
function in Equation (2) to the surface density.

By over-plotting the surface density profile and sersic profile, I
can determine which Sersic index is most accurate. I will plot these
values at all three snapshots for both the disk and bulge. A fitting
function will be used to help optimize the accuracy of the Sersic
index to help guarantee accuracy.

I expect to find that the Sersic index at the start of the simulation
to be four for the bulge and one for the disk. This is due to the the
bulge and disk having different surface densities and mass-to-light
ratios. I also expect to see these values change as the simulation
moves forward in time. The galactic merger will effect the density of
the stars and thus change the Sersic profiles.
