%%
%% \author
%% \affiliation
%% \email
%%
%% If these three commands are not available for each author, the latex

%% footnotes. NOTE that if an \altaffiliation command is used it must 
%% come BEFORE the \affiliation call, right after the \author command, in 
%% order to place the footnotes in the proper location. Because non-numeric
%% symbols are used, \altaffiliation should be used sparingly.
%%
%% In v7 the \author command takes an optional argument which provides

    MW will have a Sersic index of 1.5 and a scale length of 2 and M31
    will have a Sersic index of 2.05 and a scale length of 0.5.

\section{Introduction}

The Milky Way Galaxy (MW) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) are both
members of the Local Group. The \textbf{Local Group} is a cluster of
around fifty galaxies and spans about ten billion light-years and are all
gravitationally bound. These
two galaxies (i.e. MW and M31) will eventually undergo a galactic
merger. This is what is known as a major merger. A \textbf{major merger}
is a classification of merger event in which the mass of one progenitor is
no more than three times greater than the other.
This event will cause both galaxies to undergo serious 
cosmological changes. One thing that will evolve over the merger
is the structure of MW and M31. Both galaxies have a stellar disk region
with their own properties. The \textbf{stellar
disk} refers to the stars that make up the
disk  within each galaxy. These disks have their own unique kinematics and
smaller regions within themselves. However, these disks are found in
spiral galaxies like MW and M31. \textbf{Spiral galaxies} are galaxies
with a disk region that forms arms as the galaxy rotates. When MW and
M31 merge within the next seven billion years, these regions will
interact with each other and combine. The dynamical forces, namely the
tidal forces, will influence the result of this merger and the ongoing
evolution of the two galaxies.

Density is a property of a galaxy that influences many different
phenomena related to galactic evolution
\citep{Torrey_Cox_Kewley_Hernquist_2012}. A \textbf{galaxy} is a
gravitationally bound set of stars, gas, and dust whose
characteristics and behaviour cannot be explained with Newton's laws
of gravity \citep{Willman_Strader_2012}. \textbf{Galactic evolution} is
the process of the galaxy and its components changing over time. By
observing the surface density of the galaxies as they merge over time we
can learn about how galactic mergers influence evolution. With how old the
universe is, it is difficult to see the whole picture that is galactic
evolution. A galactic merger can hopefully allow us to see how a galaxy
evolves in a shorter amount of time.

We know that after MW and M31 merge, the merger remnant will have a
significantly larger radius than the original galaxies
\citep{van_der_Marel_Besla_Cox_Sohn_Anderson_2012}. With this, the
surface density after the merger should follow a distribution similar
to a de Vaucouleurs profile \citep{Brooks_Christensen_2016}. This
means that the new elliptical merger remnant will have its density
scale with the radius to the power of a quarter (outside of 1 kpc from
the centre). Figure 1 shows the particles originating from MW and M31
respectively after the merger. It can be seen that the shape of the
merger remnant consisting of MW and M31 should be elliptical when
viewed face on. In addition, since elliptical galaxies lack a defined disk,
something must change over the course of the merger as the two spiral
galaxies combine.

%% The "ht!" tells LaTeX to put the figure "here" first, at the "top" next
%% and to override the normal way of calculating a float position.
%% The asterisk after "figure" tells the compiler to span multiple columns
%% if a two column style is selected.

This shows that the two galaxies have the same centre of mass and have completely merged. \citep{van_der_Marel_Besla_Cox_Sohn_Anderson_2012}.
\label{fig:general}}
\end{figure}

There are several questions relating to the evolution of the surface
density profiles during the galactic merger. A very good question is
how the forces acting on the galaxies during the merger change
their surface density profiles. Hopefully, by analyzing the way the
galaxy surface density changes throughout this interaction and compare
it to the initial densities and the density of the merger remnant, we
can learn more about how galactic mergers and their density profiles
impact galactic evolution. There is also the question of how the
merger will impact the form of the two galaxies. As
aforementioned, the merger remnant should be elliptical. The shape and
density of the merger remnant could help us learn how to more easily
identify other similar merger remnants. In the same vein, something
must happen to the spiral arms of MW and M31 as the galaxies go from a
spiral classification to an elliptical merger remnant. The tidal
forces acting on the spiral arms cause them to evolve in such a way
that the arms lose their definition during the merger. The simplest
way to attempt to solve any of these questions is to use a simulation
of the galactic interactions
\citep{van_der_Marel_Besla_Cox_Sohn_Anderson_2012}.

\section{This Project} \label{sec:style}

The topic of this paper is to investigate the surface density and
Sersic profiles of MW and M31. The \textbf{Sersic profile} is a
method used to analyze the surface density of a galaxy by using the
relation between the galaxy's radius and intensity.

The question I will be answering is how the surface densities and
Sersic profiles of the disks of MW and M31 evolve over the
course of the galactic merger.

While galactic mergers result in a new galactic form, the intermediate
steps are just as important. The density and intensity of stars within
a galaxy are very important parameters for a galaxy and by calculating
and analyzing these values during the merger we may be able to see how
these distributions evolve and are affected by the forces taking place
in the merger event.

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:style}

In order to answer this question, I will have to complete a number of
steps using the N-body merger simulation. The N-body simulation is
referred to as such because it is a simulation modeling "N" number of
particles used to represent the stars within a galaxy
\citep{van_der_Marel_Besla_Cox_Sohn_Anderson_2012}. This simulation in
particular contains the stars for MW, M31, and M33 within all of their
galaxy components (i.e. halo, disk, and bulge). The simulation
contains the three dimensional positions and velocities of all these
particles as well as their mass and position in time. I will be
looking at surface density and Sersic profiles at various times for
the disk regions of both MW and M31.

As previously stated, I will look at the evolution of the disk
(i.e. particle type 2). I would
like to analyze the two galaxies at specific points in time using the
LowRes files of the simulation. The LowRes files can be used since
density is a value that does not depend on the tracking of each
individual particle within the system. I will look at the initial
conditions (i.e. snapshot 000), the first close encounter at four
gigayears (i.e. snapshot 280), and the time they separate after that
encounter at five and a half gigayears (i.e. snapshot 385). These
values were found using Figure 2 to look at the separation between MW
and M31 during the galactic merger.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{MWM31RS.png}
\caption{Plot showing the radial separation between the centre of mass of MW and M31 in kpc at a given time in Gyr. This shows us exactly when the galaxies have their first close encounter and separation.
\label{fig:general}}
\end{figure}

At these times, I will calculate the Sersic profile for each galaxy
and find the associated Sersic index and scale length that fits best. To do this, I
will need to first compute the centre of mass of each galaxy for the
given snapshot and the mass of the relevant component. I will need
to do this so that I can then find the surface density for the disk
using the equation below.
\begin{equation}
\sigma=\frac{M_{ann}}{\pi(r_n^2-r_{n-1}^2)}
\end{equation}
In order to use this equation, we must first create an annulus that
encloses the majority of the galactic region. With this, you can find
the sum of the mass enclosed at each annulus then take the difference
between the current point and the one previous to find the mass at the
current annulus value. This value is \begin{math}M_{ann}\end{math}.
\begin{math}r_{n}\end{math} is the current radius from the annulus and
\begin{math}r_{n-1}\end{math} is the radius in the index before. This
allows us to calculate our surface density over the entire component of
the galaxy \begin{math}\sigma\end{math}. With the surface densities, I
can then calculate the Sersic profiles using the equations below.
\begin{equation}
I_o=\frac{L}{\pi h_r^2(2n)!}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I(r)=I_oe^{-(\frac{r}{h_r})^\frac{1}{n}}
\end{equation}
\begin{math}L\end{math} is the luminosity of the galaxy component which
can be found using the mass-to-light ratio and
\begin{math}h_r\end{math} is the scale length. With those values
the Sersic profile \begin{math}I(r)\end{math} can be calculated at
each value of \begin{math}r\end{math}, \begin{math}r\end{math} being
the distance from the centre of the galaxy in kilo-parsecs.
\begin{math}n\end{math} is then the Sersic index that best aligns the
function in Equation (2) to the surface density.

By over-plotting the surface density profile and Sersic profile, I
can determine which Sersic index is most accurate. I will plot these
values at all three snapshots for both the disk of each galaxy. A fitting
function will be used to help optimize the accuracy of the Sersic
index to help guarantee accuracy.

I will assume that the Sersic index at the start of the simulation
is one and the scale length to be five. I also expect to see these values change as the
simulation moves forward in time. The galactic merger will effect the
density of the stars and thus change the Sersic profiles.

\section{Results} \label{sec:style}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ResultsV_000.jpg}
\caption{The initial Sersic profiles and surface density plots of MW and M31. Sersic profiles fitted to the surface densities by varying the Sersic index and mass-to-light ratio. These are the conditions of each galaxy before any close encounters (i.e. t = 0 Gyr).
\label{fig:general}}
\end{figure}

Figure 3 represents our initial conditions for the disk regions of MW
and M31. The surface density profiles were fitted for both galaxies
using the methods described in Section 3. The Sersic profiles were
calculated using Equation (3) and used the accepted values for both the Sersic index and scale length. This provides a good baseline moving forward as we know that these values and plots are correct.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ResultsV_280.jpg}
\caption{The Sersic profiles and surface density plots of MW and M31 at Snapshot 280. These are the conditions of each galaxy during the first close encounter (i.e. t = 4 Gyr).
\label{fig:general}}
\end{figure}

Figure 4 is a similar plot made at about 4 Gyr in the future. This is
when MW and M31 are undergoing their first close encounter. The plots
were made using the same methods as Figure 3, except the Sersic index and scale length were left unknown. I used a fitting function, but because the curves are not uniform, the algorithm had some difficulty determining a good fit. Ultimately, the final values for this calculation were checked by eye. We can see that the
Sersic index has decreased for the MW disk and remained constant for the M31 disk. The scale length of the MW disk remained constant and decreased
for M31.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ResultsV_385.jpg}
\caption{The Sersic profiles and surface density plots of MW and M31 at Snapshot 385. These are the conditions of each galaxy during the maximum seperation following the first close encounter (i.e. t = 5 Gyr).
\label{fig:general}}
\end{figure}

Figure 5 is another similar plot made at about 5 Gyr in the future.
This is when MW and M31 are at their maximum separation after their
first close encounter. The plots were made using the same methods as
Figure  4. We can see that the Sersic index has now increased
for the MW disk and also increased for the M31 disk. The scale length of
MW and M31 have also both decreased.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:style}

In Figure 3 we can see initial plots for the Sersic profiles and surface densities of MW and M31. The Sersic index of 1.0 and scale length of 5
were selected for both galaxies.
The known value of the Sersic index is one, at least when the
disks are orientated face on \citep{Pastrav_Popescu_Tuffs_Sansom_2013}.
This is a proper exponential Sersic profile.

In Figure 4 we can see that the Sersic index of the disk of MW
decreased to 0.9 and remained constant for M31. For Mw, this represents a
ten percent decrease. The scale length of MW remains the same and decreased to 4.5. This also represents a ten percent decrease. This is in agreement with the hypothesis I made.

The change in Sersic index represents a change in the intensity of the
galactic disks over their radius. MW will have a lower brightness
during the first close encounter of the merger (relative to their initial brightness) and M31 will have the same brightness. The scale length
describes how the surface intensity drops over the galactic radius. Since
MW and M31 are spiral galaxies, the scale factor is how many kilo-parsecs
it takes for the intensity to drop by a factor of e. This means the
intensity of M31 decreases faster at this time.

It is likely that the values found here are off by a small factor. As
aforementioned, the calculated fits were not accurate so the values were
chosen by eye. This means that there may be a value that matches the surface density better by a factor of a hundredth.

In Figure 5 we can see that the Sersic index of the disk of MW
now increased to 1.5 and increased to 2.05 for M31. This
represents a sixty-seven percent increase and a one hundred and five percent increase respectively. That means MW experiences a total
Sersic index increase of fifty percent and M31
experiences a one hundred and five percent increase over the first five gigayears of
the merger simulation. This is in agreement with the hypothesis I made.

The change in Sersic index represents a change in the intensity of the
galactic disks over their radius. MW will have a greater brightness
after the first close encounter of the merger and M31 will also have a
higher brightness (both relative to their initial brightness and their
brightness during the first close encounter).

It is likely that the values found here are off by a small factor. As
aforementioned, the calculated fits were not accurate so the values were
chosen by eye. This means that there may be a value that matches the surface density better by a factor of a hundredth.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:style}

The goal of this paper is to analyze how the density and intensity of a galaxy
changes due to galactic evolution as two galaxies experience a close
encounter. Density and intensity are both definite galactic properties
that can be used to learn more about a galaxy and how it evolves. By
using a N-body simulation of two galaxies from the Local Group, this
problem can be computed analytically. The Sersic and surface
density profiles can be calculated at certain points during the
galactic merger to learn how the galaxies change through the event.

It is important to look at both of the results from the time of the first
close encounter and the subsequent separation together. We can see that
not only do the Sersic indices change, but so can the scale lengths of the
galaxies. Both of these values do not change in the same way for each
galaxy at the same point in time, even if the initial values are the same.
We can see that they do also change from the first close encounter to
their maximum separation. Not only this, but it can be concluded that this
will continue as more close encounters occur before MW and M31 finally
merge.

This also is how the project could be further expanded. The final result of the
merger remnant can be analyzed to give a complete picture of how the
Sersic index and scale length change over the entire merger. It would also
be beneficial to include the M33 galaxy in the calculations, as it
interacts with MW and M31 as they merge meaning that it will likely
affect the results. Another future direction is to include the evolution
of the bulge, as it will also have a change in its Sersic index and
surface density as the galaxies merge. There is also a possible influence from the dark-matter halo closer to the galactic edge
\citep{Takamiya_Sofue_2000}.
